In trying to figure this out myself i was not able to find a good singular source to explains how to do some things so i figure out an easy work around. 

This works with an Ender 3 (Or any other marlin based printer) using Cura 4.8


Required Things:

1) Cura 4.8 or any recent version with the required features.
2) A model that consits of atleast two parts (One for each color)
3) Notepad++ or any other program to edit the g-code
4) "Printer Settings" Plugin https://marketplace.ultimaker.com/app/cura/plugins/fieldofview/PrinterSettingsPlugin

Section one: Setting up Cura 4.8 for Dual extrusion with single hotend

1 - Open up Cura and copy down print settings 
2 - press Ctrl+J to open up the profiles window
3 - On the left hand side of that window click "Printers"
4 - Open the "Machine Settings" for your printer (If that option is not avaiable you will most likely need to click activate at the the of the window)
5 - Copy down all the settings (Copy to a notepad or somthing)
6 - Click close on the bottom right hand corner 
7 - Click "Add" along the top of the printers window
8 - Open the dropdown for "Add a non-networked printer" 
9 - Find "Custom" 
10 - If "Custom FFF printer" is not selected, select it.
11 -  On the right hand side change the name to whatever you will rememeber
12 - Click "Add"
13 - on the printer Tab; Replace the default settings with the ones you saved.
14 - Once done change the "Number of extruders" to 2
14 - Go into each of the Extruder tabs and change the "Ccompatible material diameter" to 1.75
15 - Close the window it will autosave
16 - Install the "Printer Settings" plugin from the ultimaker marketplace https://marketplace.ultimaker.com/app/cura/plugins/fieldofview/PrinterSettingsPlugin
17 - Reboot Cura
18 - Migrate any settings from your original printer settings over as the new profile will be set to stock settings.
19 - Go down to the "Printer Settings" section of printer settings and enable "Extruders Share Heater"

You are now all set for dual printing with a single hotend.
